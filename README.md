config
======

Configurations for Eyescale Projects. Can be used to build all software
provided by Eyescale:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G Ninja
ninja
```

Alternatively it can be used as a
[Buildyard](https://github.com/Eyescale/Buildyard) configuration folder,
which is a deprecated way of building these projects.
